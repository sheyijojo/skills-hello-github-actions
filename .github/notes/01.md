# GitHub Actions Workflow Example

This workflow example demonstrates how to organize your CI/CD pipeline by separating build and test jobs. Each job has a specific responsibility:

## Build Job
- Compiles source code
- Creates build artifacts
- Prepares resources for testing

## Test Job
- Runs after build completion
- Executes test suites
- Validates code quality

This separation enables:
- Improved debugging
- Better resource utilization
- Clear workflow visualization



```yaml
test:
  runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
  strategy:
    matrix:
      os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
      node-version: [16.x, 18.x]
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
  - name: npm install, and test
    run: |
      npm install
      npm test
    env:
      CI: true


```

## Artifact Storage 

```yml
build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: npm install and build webpack
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@main
        with:
          name: webpack artifacts
          path: public/

Here, we specify public/ to upload everything to a directory.:
If we just wanted to upload a single file, we use something like public/mytext.txt:
  
To download the artifact for testing, the build must complete successfully and uploaded the artifact: 

In the following code, we specify that the test job depends on the build job:    


test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest


    steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/download-artifact@main
          with:
             name: webpack artifacts
             path: public
```


```yml
Automate reviews in GitHub using workflows:


So far, we described starting the workflow with GitHub events such as push or pull-request. We could also run a workflow on a schedule, or on some event outside of GitHub:

Sometimes, we want to run the workflow only after a person performs an action. 

For example, we might only want to run a workflow after a reviewer approves the pull request. For this scenario, we can trigger on pull-request-review.

Another action we could take is to add a label to the pull request. In this case, we use the pullreminders/label-when-approved-action action.

```
```yml
steps:
     - name: Label when approved
       uses: pullreminders/label-when-approved-action@main
       env:
         APPROVALS: "1"
         GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
         ADD_LABEL: "approved"

```
